To make this E-commerce Web Application with Real-Time Order Tracking doable within 2 weeks, you’ll need to narrow the scope and focus on the core features that showcase your abilities without getting bogged down by complex integrations. Here’s a plan to streamline the project for a two-week timeline while still wowing recruiters:

Focus on Core Features (Estimated Timeline: 2 Weeks)

Prioritize building the essential parts of an e-commerce platform that demonstrate your full-stack development skills and use cloud services without overcomplicating the setup.

Week 1: Core E-commerce Platform

    1.	Day 1-2: User Authentication and Authorization:
    •	Implement basic authentication using Devise (skip AWS Cognito for now).
    •	Set up user roles (admin, customer) for role-based access control.
    2.	Day 3-4: Product Management:
    •	Create a basic product catalog with CRUD operations for products (add, edit, delete).
    •	Use local file storage for images initially or Rails ActiveStorage with a basic S3 integration if time permits.
    3.	Day 5-6: Order Management:
    •	Implement cart and checkout functionality.
    •	Store orders in a local PostgreSQL or MySQL database (on your machine or a free-tier AWS RDS instance).

Week 2: Advanced Features and Cloud Integration

    1.	Day 7-8: Payment Integration:
    •	Integrate basic payment functionality with Stripe. Stripe has great documentation and quick integration options that can be set up in a day or two.
    •	Simplify this by only implementing a basic checkout flow for a single product or small set of products.
    2.	Day 9-10: Real-Time Order Updates:
    •	Use Rails ActionCable (built-in WebSockets) for a quick and easy implementation of real-time order status updates.
    •	Skip AWS IoT and Lambda for now but still provide real-time feedback on the order page (e.g., Order Received, In Progress, Shipped).
    3.	Day 11-12: Search Feature:
    •	Implement a simple product search using Rails’ built-in ActiveRecord queries. Skip Elasticsearch for now, but ensure that the search works for product names and descriptions.
    4.	Day 13-14: Basic Deployment:
    •	Deploy the app on Heroku (free tier), which is much faster and simpler for development than AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You can still showcase this as a scalable deployment solution.
    •	Ensure the app is accessible and test the basic functionality in a production-like environment.

Defer Complex AWS Features:

To make this project achievable in two weeks, avoid or minimize AWS services that require more time to set up:

    •	AWS Cognito/OAuth: Replace with Devise for user authentication.
    •	AWS QuickSight: Skip the analytics dashboard; focus on displaying simple admin stats within the app.
    •	AWS Lambda and SNS: Use Rails ActionCable for real-time updates.
    •	AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Use Heroku for faster deployment.

What Recruiters Will Still Find Impressive:

    1.	Complete E-commerce Flow: By building user roles, product management, cart functionality, and payment integration, you’ll demonstrate strong full-stack development skills.
    2.	Real-Time Functionality: Even with ActionCable, real-time order updates are a powerful feature that showcase modern web development techniques.
    3.	Deployment and Scaling: Deploying on Heroku will still impress recruiters, as it demonstrates the ability to get an application live and manage cloud infrastructure.

Final Tips:

    •	Documentation: Document the decisions you made, such as using Heroku for fast deployment or ActionCable for simplicity. This shows thoughtfulness in planning and trade-offs.
    •	MVP Focus: Keep each feature as simple as possible to fit into the two-week timeline. Save advanced AWS integrations for a later stage or as optional upgrades.

This approach will allow you to build a meaningful, functional e-commerce app within two weeks, providing you with a solid foundation to showcase in interviews while minimizing unnecessary complexity.
