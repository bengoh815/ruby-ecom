The duration to complete this e-commerce project depends on factors like your familiarity with Rails, the depth of each feature, and the time you can dedicate daily. Here’s an estimate based on each key feature:

Estimated Time Breakdown:

    1.	Initial Setup and User Authentication (1-2 days)
    •	Set up the Rails environment, create the user model, implement authentication (e.g., Devise), and test basic logins.
    2.	Product Management (2-3 days)
    •	Create models and controllers for products, set up image uploads with Active Storage, and build views for adding, editing, and viewing products.
    3.	Shopping Cart and Order Management (3-4 days)
    •	Set up cart functionality with session data, create order models, and implement checkout logic. This includes creating relationships between users, orders, and products.
    4.	Real-Time Order Tracking (2-3 days)
    •	Add order status updates using background jobs (Active Job with Sidekiq or Delayed Job) and configure real-time updates (using ActionCable or polling).
    5.	Payment Integration (2-3 days)
    •	Integrate Stripe or PayPal, set up secure payment processing, and handle transaction completion and order creation upon payment.
    6.	Admin Dashboard (2 days)
    •	Create views for analytics, manage product data, and display sales information in the admin dashboard.
    7.	Search and Filter Functionality (1-2 days)
    •	Implement search and filter options for products, creating views to display results.
    8.	Testing, Security, and Cleanup (2-3 days)
    •	Add tests for each critical component (using RSpec or built-in Rails tests), add user role permissions for security, and conduct final debugging.

Total Estimated Duration:

Approximately 2-3 weeks with consistent daily effort.

Tips to Streamline Development:

    •	Prioritize the core functionality first, and add complex features (e.g., real-time tracking) once the basics work.
    •	Use Scaffolds for rapid development of models, views, and controllers.
    •	Implement Iteratively by building the essential elements of each feature, then layering in details.
