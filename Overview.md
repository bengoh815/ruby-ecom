The project we’re working on is a Rails-based e-commerce web application with real-time order tracking. Here’s a high-level breakdown of what we’re aiming to build, along with each feature and its purpose.

Project Overview:

This application is an online store where users can browse products, add items to a cart, make purchases, and track orders in real time. It incorporates user authentication, secure payments, and a dynamic dashboard for administrators to manage products and monitor sales. The goal is to provide a complete e-commerce experience, covering essential functionality for both users and admins.

Key Features and Purpose:

    1.	User Authentication & Authorization
    •	Purpose: Allows different user roles (e.g., customers and admins) to access specific sections and functionalities of the app.
    •	Details: Users can sign up and log in, and admins have permissions to manage product listings and monitor orders.
    2.	Product Management
    •	Purpose: Allows admins to add, edit, or delete product listings with details like images, descriptions, prices, and categories.
    •	Implementation: Using Rails Active Storage, images are uploaded and associated with products in the database. Admins have full control over the product catalog.
    3.	Shopping Cart and Order Management
    •	Purpose: Enables users to browse and add products to a cart and proceed to checkout.
    •	Implementation: Users’ cart data is stored in the database, and orders are created upon checkout, containing information about items purchased, quantities, and user details.
    4.	Real-Time Order Tracking
    •	Purpose: Users can track their order status from processing to delivery, updating in real-time to reflect each stage.
    •	Implementation: This could involve a background job that updates the order status in the database at regular intervals, potentially using ActionCable or another real-time update mechanism.
    5.	Payment Integration
    •	Purpose: Allows users to make secure payments for their orders.
    •	Implementation: Integrates with payment processors like Stripe or PayPal, providing seamless and secure transactions.
    6.	Analytics Dashboard (Admin)
    •	Purpose: Allows admins to track sales, monitor product performance, and view trends.
    •	Implementation: Uses Rails views to create an admin dashboard that aggregates data from the database, providing visual insights into sales and user activity.
    7.	Search and Filter Functionality
    •	Purpose: Helps users quickly find products using categories, keywords, or price filters.
    •	Implementation: Uses Rails ActiveRecord queries or a search library to filter products based on specified criteria.

Learning Outcomes:

This project provides an excellent hands-on experience with Ruby on Rails fundamentals and teaches skills that are directly relevant to building web applications. Here’s a summary of what you’ll learn:

    •	Rails MVC Architecture: Organizing your application into models, views, and controllers.
    •	RESTful Routing and Controllers: Setting up routes and actions for CRUD operations.
    •	Active Record (ORM): Interacting with the database and handling data relations.
    •	Testing and Security: Writing tests for critical features, securing user data, and implementing secure payment processing.
    •	Real-Time Updates and Background Jobs: Adding real-time functionality and background processing for tracking and updating order status.

This project is both comprehensive and highly applicable, covering many core skills that would impress recruiters and prepare you for real-world Rails development. Let me know if you want further guidance on any part of this!
